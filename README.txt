In my first year of university, I took my very first Java course where I was introduced to object oriented programming. Our final project was to create a car dealership simulator to store information on different types of vehicles, the sales team, the transactions etc. This was a way to show we understood the role of classes in object oriented programming and that we could link all of them together to create one master project. 
My knowledge at the time I created this project was very introductory and I think it's very interesting to see how my understanding of concepts has grown since then.
